Overview:
This program allows the player to play TicTacToe, Default Gomoku, and generalized gomoku (explained more in extra credit section)

For TicTacToe:
It creates a 5x5 board (only middle 3x3 playable).
Team X and Team O take turns moving and th board program checks to see
if either player has won, tied, or quit after every move.
Either player can quit by typing "quit" as the input rather than valid coordinates

For Gomoku:
It creates a 21x21 board (only middle 19X19 playable).
Team Black and White take turns moving and the board program checks to see 
if either player has won, tied, or quit after every move.
Either player can quit by typing "quit" as thew input rather than valid coordinates
